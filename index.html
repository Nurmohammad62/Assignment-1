            <h2>My recipies</h2>
            <p>Back in early February, before the world as we knew it changed, I hosted 20 people at my home in Chicago. Crowding around a dining table packed to the edges with my favorite Syrian Jewish dishes, we ate and talked about the Syrian war.</p>

                <h3>Yummy Sweets</h3>
                <p>After indulging in a hearty meal, you're bursting at the seams but when a lemon tart or a pretty cupcake arrives at the table - you somehow, miraculously, have room for that too. Let's be honest: we all love desserts, and who can blame us.</p>

                <h3>Vegetable Salad</h3>
                <p>This is a refreshing salad using all different kinds of vegetables. You can use whatever you like, but the main things that makes it good are the tomatoes and cucumbers. It is much like an Israeli salad. The homemade dressing is very good on it, but so is just plain olive oil.</p>
